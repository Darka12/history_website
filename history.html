    <h2>World War 2 in Plymouth</h2>
    <div class="info">
    <p>In July 1940 the Nazi German Luftwaffe carried out bommbing raids on the City of Plymouth. This event was known as the Plymouth Blitz.</p><br>
    <p>The main targets of the air raids were the dockyards at HMNB Devonport to help the Nazi's battle in the Atlantic. The results of these air raids were disastrous, they ruined a lot of the city structures and killed over 1000 people as well as injuring over 4000.</p><br>
    <p>During the disastrous effects fo the war on they city, the population of Plymouth fell from 220,000 to 127,000 as some people moved into the countryside and a lot of children were evacuated.</p><br>
    <p>In 1941 the St Andrews Parish Church, Charles Church and the Marine Biological Association Laboratory were badly bombed.</p><br>
    <p>In April 1941 the air raid shelter in Portland Square was hit during an attack and it killed 76 people.</p><br>
    <p>On top of all of that two shopping centres, civic buildings, 26 schools, 8 cinemas, 41 churches, and 3754 houses were completely destroyed. By 1944 there were 1000 people killed, 5000 injured, and 10,000 houses destroyed.</p><br>
